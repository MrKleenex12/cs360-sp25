## Global and Local Variables

- The computer architecture you use matters a lot
- a system determines how large your registers are
- the size of your registers determine how large your pointers are

### Registers

*We are assuming a general computer architechture.*

Let's assume there are 8 general-purpose registers in the CPU. All registers are 4 bytes and  
the user has read and write access. The first 5 are: r0, r1, r2, r3, and r4. Last three are special:

- **sp** is called the "stack pointer"
- **fp** is called the "frame pointer"
- **pc** is called the "program counter"

Additionally the computer has 3 read-only registers, which always contain the same value:

- **g0**, whose value is always zero
- **g1**, whose value is always one
- **gm1**, whose value is always negative one
