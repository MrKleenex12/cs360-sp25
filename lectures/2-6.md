# Notes from 2/6/25 lecture

## Files and Directories

- System calls are expensive
- Amortize the system calls by using a larger buffer size

### simpcat1 vs simpcat3

Although simpcat3 doesn't have any system calls, it takes 4 times as long because it has 4 parameters  
in the fread function. getchar() and putchar() are very fast for single characters.

### EOF

EOF is defined in stdio.h as (-1). getchar() returns an int because it needs the full 4 bytes. Using a char shortens  
the data received.

## I Nodes

use *-i* for ls to see the file's file serial number (inode number)

think of links being used to certain files. Files can have multiple links.

use *ln* to link files

*rm* doesn't neccessarily delete files or information, it deletes the links

## notes/Sh

0 - stdin
1 - stdout
2 - stderr

dup2(fd, 1) - See man page for more info

head - displays the first _ bytes of a file. See man page for more info

### Shell Redirection

use *>* to redirect

**Ex**: cat f1 f3 3>f2 1>f5 2>&1 1>&3
