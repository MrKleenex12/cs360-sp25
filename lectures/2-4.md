## Filesystem - hierarchical arrangement of directories

**df**  
Command to see filesystems on your machine

Each line shows a different filesystem. The first entry on the line shows where the filesystem is,  
and the last shows how you access it on your machine.

## Names, Paths, Directories

- **Filename**: The name of a file as it appears in a directory
- **Pathname**: A sequence of zero or more filenames, separated by slashes

**ls -a**  
list **all** the filenames in the directory(including the files beginning with ",").

Note: there are two filenames that are in every directory: "." and ".."  
"." is the current directory. ".." is the parent of the current directory.

## Error handling

**errno**  
Global variable that is used to indicate what error occured

*See notes/Chap1/src/ch1a.c*  

## Signals

- **Signal**: An interruption of a program
- **Signal Handler**: The mechanism by which the program may gracefully deal with signals.

*See notes/Chap1/src/ch1c.c*  

Typing **< CTRL-Z >** while the program is running will send a **"STOP** to the program. If you  
type **ps**,  you'll see something like  

*2483 p5 T 0:00 ch1c*  

** The "T" means that the process is not running -- it has stopped. To start it, you can type "fg",  
which will send it the start signal.
